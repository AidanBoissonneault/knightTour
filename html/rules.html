                A standard Knights Tour.
                Play as a chess knight and land on every square exactly once.

            <h2 class="text-3d">MULTIPLAYER</h2>
            <p>
                Two knights play on a shared knights tour.
                Both knights alternate moves, with white starting first.
                If a knight runs out of moves, or is captured by the opposing knight, they lose the match.
                In online multiplayer, the host is always white.
